# NewsMaker
Here we have made a search engine for all news , using the news API


Based on the keywords mentioned in the search bar , our app essentially sends API to newsAPI.
The response is parsed using retrofit and displayed using recycler views.

We also stored the previously searched results in a local database called ROOM
